            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of the Maſters or Gouernors of the Myſterie and Comminaltie of Barbers and Chirurgions of LONDON.</head>
            <p>MOST humbly ſhewing, That the Petitioners being an Ancient Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and confirmed, and their Science and Profeſsion conſisting not onely in outward practiſe and experience, but alſo in the Theorie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the cauſes of all manner of outward Soares, Blanes, Swellings, Impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and the wounds and cauſes of the ſame, and the Symptomes that doe follow and accompanie them, and of the natures and qualities of all manner of Salues, Plaiſters, Balmes, Oyntments, Baths, Poulteſſes, Waters, Herbs, and all other things fitting the cure of ſuch diſeaſes, and fit to be miniſtred or applied for the curing thereof. And the Petitioners haue not onely ſerued many yeeres, and beene trained and brought vp in the ſaid Arte and Science, but haue by their ſtudie, practiſe and experience, attained ſuch knowledge and perfection therein as tendeth not onely to the maintenance of themſelues, their wiues, children and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but to the great good of the Kings people both by Sea and Land in their liues and limbes.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo it is, That the Phyſitions of London (being graue learned men, worthy of all lawfull fauour in their owne Profeſsions) haue of late obtained a Grant or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from his Maieſtie, whereby they doe not onely ſeeke to haue a ſuperintendencie ouer the Petitioners in their owne Profeſsion, But alſo ſeeke to abridge the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to reſtraine them from vſing part of their Arte, which they haue ſtudied and ſerued for, and haue done and doe lawfully vſe, and without which many times they cannot performe their Cures, nor giue ſuch eaſe and remedie to their Patients as is fit they ſhould doe; In which reſpect the ſaid Grant will be very preiudiciall to the Petitioners, and all his Maieſties Subiests, who ſhall haue occaſion to vſe their helpe, if the ſame ſhould be confirmed by Act of Parliament, as the ſaid Phyſitions deſire.</p>
            <p>The humble ſute of the Petitioners is, That either no Act may paſſe for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his ſaid Maieſties Grant vnto the Phyſitions; Or if any ſhall paſſe, that the Petitioners may be heard. And if vpon hearing, it ſhall ſeeme good to this Honorable Houſe a <hi>Proviſo</hi> or ſauing may be therein contained, that the Petitioners may not be any way reſtrained thereby, but may in all things vſe their ſaid Profeſsion, as they haue heretofore lawfully done, and may lawfully vſe the ſame, And the Petitioners as by dutie bound, ſhall daily pray, &amp;c.</p>
